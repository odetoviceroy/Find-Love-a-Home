            during difficult times, and those who may need urgent care or funds in order for them to remove
            themselves from a hostile environment. We provide a safe way in order for anyone who might need
            help to reach out to others by submitting a request for crowdfunding to help keep themselves
            out of danger and know that they are loved are cared for by fellow members of the LGBTQ+ community
            and their allies. </p>
